##  A task manager built with rails.

Taskr is a "Trello like" task manager being built with Rails. The styling is primarily done with Bootstrap.

 It allows for users to sign up, log in, delete their account, add tasks, delete tasks, and move tasks.

 ### How to Get Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `bundle` in the terminal to install the necessary ruby gems.
3. Start the rails server by typing `rails s` into your terminal.
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view your application locally.



### About
Taskr was made for me to get more experience with ``Rails`` development. The instruction was provided by ``Vishay Bhatia``. Because this was an exercise is Rails development, very little other code was used. ``Bootstrap`` was primarily used for stylings and the Taskr logo icon is from ``Font Awesome``. The site was
deployed to ``Heroku`` using the command line and currently does not update
with master. That will be implemented at a later time.


### Future updates.

For the future, I'll most likely add some better `CSS` stylings as well as implement live updating from the ``GitHub`` master.
